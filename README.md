## Steps necessary to run the software

### 1. Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) 3.10 or newer
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- Access to a MongoDB database. We use a shared [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas) cluster; the connection details are in the `.env` file shared privately with team members and course admins.

### 2. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/software-students-fall2026/web-app-exercise-byteme.git
cd web-app-exercise-byteme
```

### 3. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies

macOS / Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Windows (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a file named `.env` in the project root. Use `env.example` as a template:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Then fill in the real values:

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `MONGO_URI` | MongoDB connection string, e.g. `mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster-host>/` |
| `MONGO_DBNAME` | Database name: `lost_and_found` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Any long random string (used by Flask to sign session cookies) |

The `.env` file contains private credentials and must never be committed. It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8000 in a browser.

The app is designed for phones. On a computer, use your browser's mobile view: in Chrome, open DevTools (`Cmd + Option + I` / `Ctrl + Shift + I`) and click "Toggle device toolbar".

> If port 8000 is already in use on your machine, change the port in the last line of `app.py`.

## Data model

All posts are stored in a single MongoDB collection, `items`:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `_id` | ObjectId | created automatically by MongoDB |
| `type` | string | `"lost"` or `"found"` |
| `title` | string | short item name, e.g. "Black AirPods case" |
| `description` | string | more details about the item |
| `category` | string | one of `CATEGORIES` in `constants.py` |
| `building` | string | one of `BUILDINGS` in `constants.py` |
| `location` | string | room or spot, e.g. "4th floor" |
| `date` | datetime | when the item was lost or found |
| `contact` | string | email or phone of the poster |
| `status` | string | `"open"` or `"claimed"` |
| `created_at` | datetime | when the post was created |
| `updated_at` | datetime | when the post was last edited |
